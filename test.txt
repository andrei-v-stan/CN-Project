Projects Evaluation and Marking. Requirements (ro):

- The mandatory assessment regulations set the following requirements: project based evaluation ended up with a positive grade. The project consists in the implementation of a software application using different network programming paradigms in C and C++ standard and Linux/UNIX operating system.
- The list of the proposed projects will be posted by the middle of the semester.
- Students may start handing in the projects from the 12th week of the first semestre. Projects from cathegories A, B, and C must be handed in during the 12th, 13th, and 14th weeks. The projects delivered in the first two weeks (12 and 13) will get an extra point as a bonus. A documentation (text, LaTeX, XHTML) must be enclosed to the project. It is mandatory to post both the project and the documentation on the required platfom or sent to the seminar assistant or the mark will not be granted.
- The project is rated as ongoing evaluation and it cannot be presented during the evaluation or re-evaluation session.
- No delays are allowed after the due date of the projects. The lack of the project leads to the impossibility of completing the student's academic record for the current semestre.
- Any fraud attempt will result in measures being taken: failure due to academic dishonesty, the proposal to expell the student in question.

The sources of the projects must exclusively refer to code under the incidence of a GNU GPL (General Public License)

+ The suggested themes for the projects belong to three cathegories (for each project category, a concurrent server must be implemented; otherwise, the P component will not obtain a passing score):
    - advanced level - up to 10 points (these are the projects with a higher degree of difficulty. Advanced programming techniques are to be employed. In case data saving is required, relational data bases or XML/JSON documents are to be employed);
    - intermediate level - up to 8 points (these are the medium difficulty projects);
    - entry-level - up to 6 points (these are the lowest difficulty projects).

* An outstanding or otherwise exceptional contribution may lead to a maximum of 2 additional points to the project grade.
* A student may choose a project in a category of his/her liking. Interesting project suggestions from students are also accepted, provided these are previously reviewed with the lab teacher.
